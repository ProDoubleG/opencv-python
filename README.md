Fall detection algorithm uses the coordinates of nose and two sides of waist to calcualte the tilt of upper-body.
So detection is not reliable when person's head/face(coordinate) is not visible or hidden by other parts of the body.
This defect will be improved after testing with diverse falling poses.
